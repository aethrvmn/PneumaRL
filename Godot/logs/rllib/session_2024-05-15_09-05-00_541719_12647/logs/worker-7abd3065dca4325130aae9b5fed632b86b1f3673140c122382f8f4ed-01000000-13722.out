Your video card drivers seem not to support the required Vulkan version.

If possible, consider updating your video card drivers or using the OpenGL 3 driver.

You can enable the OpenGL 3 driver by starting the engine from the
command line with the command:

    "pneuma.x86_64" --rendering-driver opengl3

If you recently updated your video card drivers, try rebooting.
